## Why?

- For everyone who wants to become a cool kid.
- For everyone who loves working with a terminal rather than GUI.
- For everyone who needs to feel how extensibility of the GNU/Linux Operating
  System.

## Commands

Make sure you can run all these commands before you get started.

- **rfkill** -  tool for enabling and disabling wireless devices
- **wpa_passphrase** - Generate a WPA PSK from an ASCII passphrase for a SSID
- **wpa_supplicant** - Wi-Fi Protected Access client and IEEE 802.1X supplicant
- **ip** -  show / manipulate routing, network devices, interfaces and tunnels
- **iw** - show / manipulate wireless devices and their configuration
- **dhcpcd** - a DHCP client

## Main

- First, unlock your wifi device if it's locked.

```sh
sudo rfkill unblock wifi
```

- Secondly, turn on your wireless interface. In my case, the wireless interface
  is `wlan0`. Your wireless interface may look different, like `wlp1s0`
  (predictable network interface). But to know what does it look like, type **ip
  a**.

```sh
sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```

- Thirdly, scan for SSID (wifi name) and ask your neighbor what the password is.
  If it's your wifi, go to the next step.

```sh
sudo iw dev wlan0 scan | grep SSID
```

- Fourthly, generate a config file, replace your corresponding SSID & password.
  In my case, SSID is **Huynh Van Tai**, and the password is **hanxinhdep**.

```sh
wpa_passphrase "Huynh Van Tai" "hanxinhdep" > xxx.conf
```

- Fifthly, connect to Wi-Fi using the config file

```sh
sudo wpa_supplicant -c xxx.conf -i wlan0 & disown
```

- Finally, get the IP address & other things with the DHCP client.

```sh
sudo dhcpcd wlan0
```
