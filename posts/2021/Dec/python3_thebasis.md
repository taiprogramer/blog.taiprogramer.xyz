## Things to remember

- Thank Guido van Rossum for creating a beautiful programming language.
- Python is a dynamic typing language. (You donâ€™t need to specify the type of
  the variable. The variable can be anything. If you want to denote the data
  type for your big project, from Python3.6 you can)
- Space is important.
- Use .editorconfig to make your codebase consistent and your partners happy.

## If-else

```py
name = "Guido van Rossum"

if name == "Le Dao": # part 1 (can standalone)
    print("My little world!.")
elif name == "Guido van Rossum": # part 2 (can be multiple)
    print("He is the creator of Python programming language.")
else: # part 3 (must be only one)
    print("Just a person exists on this planet.")
```

## Loop

- while

```py
x = 1
while x <= 10:
    print("Guido van Rossum.")
    x += 1

# infinity loop
while True:
    # do something.
    break # to break this loop if needed
```

- for

```py
# print "I love you" 10 times.
for i in range(10):
    print("I love you.")

# loop through a list.
my_num = [5, 7]
for num in my_num:
    # do everything with every single num.
```

## Logical operators

Python logical operators: **and**, **or**, **not**. You can use them to combine
conditional statements.

```py
gpa = 3.99

if gpa > 3.2 and gpa <= 4:
    print("You have a high GPA. Ya. That's it.",
            "A high score doesn't mean anything.",
            "If you can't solve problems or help others, you suck.")
```

## Function

Function in Python can return anything. There is no need to specify the return
type of function.

- Without argument

```py
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

- With argument

```py
def say_hello(name):
    print("Hello,", name)

say_hello("Donald J Trump") # output: Hello, Donald J Trump
```

- Return something

```py
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b

# call
print(sum(5, 7)) # output: 12
print(sum("7", "9")) # output: "79", funny, right?
```

## Class

Examples say a thousand words.

```py
class Person:
    # constructor
    def __init__(self, name, dob, sex):
        # the first argument ("self") represents the current object.
        # The name of the first argument can be anything. But use "self" to make
        # others happy.
        self.name = name
        self.dob = dob
        self.sex = sex

    # Define methods (A method is a function that an instance of a class calls
    # it (obj.method_name))
    # It is humanity. Don't be shy.
    def eat(self, food):
        print(f"{self.name} is eating {food}.")
    def sleep(self, hour):
        print(f"{self.name} is sleeping about {hour} hour(s).")
    def make_love(self, person, duration):
        print(f"{self.name} is making love with {person.name} in {duration}",
        "minutes.")
    def shit(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is shitting.")
    def __str__(self): # define a string to print when print(obj) called.
        return f"My name is {self.name}. My birthday is {self.dob}."
# use of the class Person
tai = Person(name="Tai", dob="05/05/2000", sex="Male")
dao = Person(name="Dao", dob="05/05/2000", sex="Female")

print(tai) # print the value that returned from __str__
# output: My name is Tai. My birthday is 05/05/2000.

tai.eat("Apple") # output: Tai is eating Apple.
dao.eat("Banh trang tron") # output: Dao is eating Banh trang tron.
tai.make_love(dao, 90) # output: Tai is making love with Dao in 90 minutes.
```

Now, your turn.
