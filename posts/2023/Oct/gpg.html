<ul>
<li>My data is important - I have a lot of things to hide :))</li>
<li>No body cares about your data until they do - protect the data
now.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="generate-new-key-pair">Generate new key pair</h2>
<p>We will generate 2 keys: public key &amp; private key. Public key is
used for encrypting, verifying digital signatures. It can be public and
should be public, the world will use this key to encrypt the messages
before sending them to you. On the contrary, the private key is used for
decrypting, signing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install <strong>gpg</strong>: If you're using the GNU/Linux
operating system, the software should be available. If you're using
other OSes, seek the document how to install gpg on these systems, make
sure you can run gpg in your terminal.</li>
<li>To generate new key pair:</li>

Your selection? 1

RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (3072) 4096
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
0 = key does not expire
...

<p><strong>gpg</strong> should ask you the password for encrypting the
private key. Make sure to use the <strong>strong</strong> password.</p>
<p>Notice the USER-ID, we will use it later "Thomas Shelby &lt;<a

<h2 id="encryptdecrypt-a-file">Encrypt/Decrypt a file</h2>
<p>You can encrypt/decrypt any type of files (it's just a file). I'll
demonstrate with a text file (universal interface).</p>
<p>Create a new text file with your message</p>

<p><strong>gpg</strong> will ask you for the passphrase of the private
